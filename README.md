# JS Harvard Art Search App

### Description

- Using the Harvard Art API to build an art a simple search engine.
- It can be seen at https://art-is-life.netlify.app/

### What I Learned:

- How to use to use try/catch/finally blocks to query data.
- How to use async/await functions to get retuned data from an API.
- Our first exposure to Array and Object destructuring

### What I am Proud Of:

- The app was a real success and provides a great example of how a search engine works.
- Understanding the full ife cycle of fetching, processing, and rendering data to page.

### How I Would Uplevel It:

- On page load I would like to add some default content.
